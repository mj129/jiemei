# Abstract.
#abstract = "The performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classiﬁcation relies on the pixel information obtained from hundreds of contiguous and narrow spectral bands. Existing approaches, however, are limited to exploit an appropriate latent subspace for data representation within the pixel-level or superpixellevel. To utilize spectral information and spatial correlation among pixels in HSI and avoid the “salt-and-pepper” problem generated in the pixel-based HSI classiﬁcation, a novel pixellevel and superpixel-level aware subspace learning method called PSASL is developed. The PSASL constructs the subspace learning framework based on the reconstruction independent component analysis algorithm. The spectral–spatial graph regularization and label space regularization are developed as the pixel-level constraints. To avoid the “salt-and-pepper” problem generated in the pixel-based classiﬁcation methods, superpixel-level constraints are introduced for integrating the data representations deﬁned in the subspace and class probabilities of the pixels in the same superpixel. The subspace learning and the pixellevel regularization are combined with the superpixel-level regularization to form a uniﬁed objective function. The solution to the objective function is efﬁciently achieved by employing a customized iterative algorithm, and it converges very fast. A discriminative data representation and a universal multiclass classiﬁer are learned simultaneously. We test the PSASL on three widely used HSI data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method over many recently proposed methods in HSI classiﬁcation."
